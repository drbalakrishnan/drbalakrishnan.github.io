### Regular courses
#### Experiment Design
I have developed this course for the first year master of exerpimental physics. Two of the  objectives of this course are for the students to acquaint themselves with the application of several experimental techniques and to quantitatively argue the suitability of a technique for a given physical problem. During this course students design and exectue their own experiments in teams and study the necessary knowledge of data analysis, hardware interfacing, and presentation of scientific data.
The central goal behind these outcomes is to empower all students to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges. For this purpose, a major part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams.

#### Nature of Matter
This course covers main topics of solid state physics for the third year bachelor of physics. As part of this course, students are required to play with instructive jupyter notebooks and write some of their own. We collect these notebooks in the [More Is Different repository](https://github.com/SanliFaez/MoreIsDifferent) and welcome other students and teachers to use them and also contribute.

### Project supervision
In [our lab](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nanophotonics/education/masters-research-projects), we regularly define experimental projects for bachelor and master students. Contact me if you are interested in choosing a very cool experimental project.
