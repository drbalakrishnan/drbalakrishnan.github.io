Together with Liesbeth van de Grift and Erik van Sebille, we presented the UYA [Climate Action Pledge](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/the-utrecht-young-academy-appeals-to-uu-leadership-at-pathways-to-sustainability-conference-2020) to the President of the Executive Board of Utrecht Univesity, Anton Pijpers. We appealed to the Utrecht University leadership to step up sustainability ambitions and sign a pledge. The UYA Climate Action Pledge embodies both the acknowledgement of the high risk of our current national policies and the urgency of action, as well as key suggestions for an adequate response to the climate crisis. The president stated the board's support for our actions and adn that they will adopt the pledge and concomitant actions.
