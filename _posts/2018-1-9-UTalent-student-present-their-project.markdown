Last September, 4 students from the [U-Talent][utalent] program performed their final project in our group. They used a DIY-microscope, previously developed in the bachelor project of Kevin Namink, to measure the Brownian motion of nanoparticles. Their goal was to measure the viscosity of the liquid by determination of the Diffusion constant. _De Odysee van een deeltje in een suspensie_ was presented with remarkable confidence by
Lucas Abbenhuis, Evert Sarolea, Samuel Klumpers, and Jip Ridderbos during the final [thesis-symposium][symposium] in an almost full classroom. Here is a shot from the back of the room.
