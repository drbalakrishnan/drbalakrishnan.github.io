I helped my colleagues at the [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development) and the [Dutch degrowth platform](http://www.ontgroei.nl/) to organize the [2nd Utrecht Degrowth Symposium: From circular economy to circular society](https://www.uu.nl/en/events/online-utrecht-degrowth-symposium-from-circular-economy-to-circular-society). In this symposium, we connected to stakeholders from academic and non-academic institutions to discuss the holistic societal transformations needed to address the pressing socio-ecological crisis of the 21st century on climate change and resource depletion.
