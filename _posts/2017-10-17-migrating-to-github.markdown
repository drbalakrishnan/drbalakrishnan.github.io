After several years of happily administring my personal pages with the mediawiki software on [my old website][oldwebsite] and less happily paying the ever-increasing hosting fees, I thought of migrating to the [github pages][githubpages]. Those payments for hosting fees are much better spent if I donate them to the Wikimedia Foundation, and their exciting recent initiative [the wikitribune][wikitribune].

After looking around for a while, I finally chose the beautiful [Uno][uno] theme, made by Josh Gerdes, and here we are, testing the new website with the first post. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. It turns to be very easy to set up a beautiful multi-page website, once you get hold of a few basic rules. Shout out to all the open-source community and their wonderful collective achievements.
